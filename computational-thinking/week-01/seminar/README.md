# Computational Thinking Week 01 Seminar

**Remember to give a break every hour or so.**

**Equipment required:**

- Computer for the slides.
- A switch if possible -- used to demonstrate how a computer works internally.

## Introduction

This is the first week of the module, so do general introductions. Use the following questions:

- Who am I? (lecturer)
- Then for each student:
  - Ask name.
  - Ask why they are here.

The goal is to get the students engaged with the idea of studying computing. Check that they understand what the subject is and they are committed to the study of computational thinking.

## What is Computational Thinking?

**First, ask the students what they think computational thinking is. Write it on the board.**

There are different views, but we will use the following:

- **Decomposition** -- the breaking down of a complex problem or system into smaller parts that can be worked on.
- **Data representation** -- how to represent data on a computer. This is the focus of this lesson.
- **Abstraction** -- focusing on the required information and not the low level detail.
- **Algorithms** -- a sequence of instructions or a recipe that a can be used to solve a problem.

## Switches and Transistors

**Ask if they know the basic components of a computer. Draw the students towards the idea of a transistor -- essentially a tiny switch.**

The goal here is for students to start understanding how a computer operates at the lowest level. Part of this process is to breaking down some of the misconceptions about what a computer can do. Focus on the idea of a switch flipping on and off and ask if they understand this. Ask what they think it means for their understanding of a computer.

## Activity -- Counting Using Switches

Get the students to work in pairs or small groups. Then ask them to solve the following problem:

- You have four switches.
- Each switch can either be on or off.
- Using these four switches, represent the numbers 0 to 15.

We are introducing the concept of binary number representation, which is at the heart of all data representation. The solution is just binary numbers.

From the simple on and off idea, move into the concept of 0 and 1 to represent on and off. If there is time, you can discuss:

- Bits and bytes, all the way to GB.
- Binary arithmetic -- keep it at addition.

## Switches in a Modern Computer

It is now time to highlight how many switches a computer can have inside, and how it operates. This is an abstract idea, but should get to the heart of how the computer is working.

- Apple M1 Pro Max processor -- can have up to 57 billion transistors/switches.
- 16GB of memory is basically 128 billion switches.
- Computer just spends its time flipping switches.
  - 64 bit CPU means flipping 64 bits in an operation (sort of).
  - 3GHz CPU performs 3 billion operations a second (sort of).
  - This 192 billion switch flips per second (this is an exaggeration -- more is going on but it gives a sense of scale).

## Data Representation

Introduce the idea that data is just numbers for a computer -- we have binary digits and we can equate these to numbers. We will explore some examples.

### 4K Screen

First -- ask the students if they know how a digital image is represented.

From there, introduce the idea of RGB data representation.

- 8 bits to represent each basic colour -- red, green, and blue.
- 24 bits total for a single pixel.
- 4K pixels means approximately 200 million bits (or switches).

### Text

Ask the students if they can determine how to represent text data.

Go through the basic concept of ASCII.

### Sound

Show a sound wave. Explain how it is just numbers representing a sound wave and this can be stored in a computer and then translated back to audio via a speaker.

## What Other Data Can a Computer Represent?

A general conversation on what other data types we can represent. If possible try and work out how this data could be represented. For example, time can be represented by the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 (Unix Time).

## Programmer's Aptitude Test

[Computer Programming Aptitude Test (kent.ac.uk)](https://www.kent.ac.uk/ces/tests/computer-test.html)

Give the students a break before this.

The point of the test is to discuss the skills required to study computing successfully. It isn't about doing well in the test. Also take the test yourself to show your grade. Students should put their score into Moodle using the bands described on the test.

Points to discuss:

- Attention to detail.
- Thinking about how data is stored.
- Pattern recognition.
