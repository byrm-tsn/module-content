6. - Computational Thinking Seminar 03 -- Algorithms

     These tutorials are designed to teach you a number of techniques. The goal of each problem is not to solve that specific problem, but to exercise a certain set of skills, or to practice solving a certain type of problem. As all of you know an algorithm is the list of instructions and rules that a computer needs to do to complete a task. In computing, algorithms provide computers with a successive guide to completing actions. They are comprised of a precise list of instructions that outline exactly how to complete a task. 

     Most importantly, computer algorithms work via input and output. They take the input and apply each step of the algorithm to that information to generate an output. For example, a search engine is an algorithm that takes a search query as an input and searches its database for items relevant to the words in the query. It then outputs the results. In this instance, now we are going to implement our knowledge. Throughout the below exercises we will examine a number of different algorithms to perform a variety of tasks.
   
     ## Exercises 
   
     1. Design an algorithm for adding the test scores as given below:
   
        26, 49, 98, 87, 62, 75
   
     2. Given a list of positive numbers, return the largest number on the list.
   
        Inputs: A list L of positive numbers. This list must contain at least one number. (Asking for the largest number in a list of no numbers is not a meaningful question.) 
   
        Outputs: A number n, which will be the largest number of the list.
   
        Finally, does this algorithm meets the criteria for being an algorithm?
   
     3. Design an algorithm which generates even numbers between 1000 and 2000 and then prints them in the standard output. It should also print total sum. 
   
     4. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared, and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. Write Bubble Sort algorithm.  
   
     5. Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection. Write Linear search algorithm. 
   
     6. Design an algorithm when boarding an airplane each passengers boarding card must be checked, if the card is not for that flight, they should be denied boarding, otherwise they may proceed. 
   
     7. Design an algorithm when a user has entered a wrong password, they have the option to have a new password emailed to them. If this option is selected a new password will be generated, the password will then be sent out in an email to the user and then encrypted and stored in the database. 
   
     8. Design an algorithm for an online banking application allows users to perform a number of operations on their bank account. The following description covers the actions of the system once the user has logged in and selected an account. The options will work as follows:
   
        - Show Balance will retrieve the balance from the database and display it on the page.
        - Show transactions will retrieve a transaction from the database and display it on the page, this will continue until there are no more transactions to display.
