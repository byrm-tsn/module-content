# Computational Thinking Seminar 04 -- Introduction to Algorithms

**Remember to give a break every hour or so.**

## Review and Recap

Start the session by asking the students to write down the top three things they learned last week. Then ask them to tell the class. Focus on correcting any misunderstandings and reflecting on the critical essential takeaways.

## Introduction

These tutorials are designed to teach several techniques. The goal is to solve that specific problem and exercise a particular set of skills or practice solving a particular type of problem. 

First, introduce the concept of an algorithm at the highest level. At the most superficial level, an algorithm is a series of instructions used to solve a problem. The instructions need to be simple, easy to understand (replicable), and in the correct order to solve a problem. An example of an algorithm is a recipe.

### Boiling an Egg

For the recipe, ask the steps in boiling an egg. Here is an example if need be.

1. Fill the saucepan with water.
2. Turn on the hob to high heat.
3. Put the saucepan on the hob.
4. Wait for the water to boil.
5. Add egg to water.
6. Wait for one minute.
7. Remove saucepan from the hob.
8. Wait for six minutes.
9. Remove egg from water.

Once they are happy with the general idea of following precise steps, reflect on what we need to perform the egg boiling algorithm: saucepan, water, hob, and egg.

## Input-Process-Output

An algorithm is not just a series of steps. It requires some inputs, a series of steps (process), and the output. Reflect on what these are for boiling an egg:

- Input
  - Water
  - Egg
  - Saucepan
- Process
- Output
  - Boiled egg

Draw a diagram of input-process-output, showing a black box in the middle for the process. Programmers are the people who create what goes in the black box -- converting input into output.

You can draw this as a recipe card, e.g., what you will need, numbered steps.

### Next Recipe -- Making Bread

Now use a bread making recipe.

- **Ingredients**
  - 500g of white flour.
  - 2 tsp salt.
  - 7g yeast.
  - 3 tbsp olive oil.
  - 300ml water.
- **Utensils**
  - Large bowl.
  - Bowl for rising.
  - Cling film.
  - Baking tray.
  - Oven.
  - Sharp knife.
  - Wire rack.
- **Steps (process)**
  1. Mix 500g white flour, 2 tsp salt, and 7g yeast in a large bowl.
  2. Make a well in the centre.
  3. Add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300 ml of water.
  4. Mix well.
  5. Knead for 10 minutes.
  6. Put the dough in the bowl.
  7. Cover bowl with cling film.
  8. Wait for one hour.
  9. Knockback the dough.
  10. Mould the dough into a ball.
  11. Place dough on the baking tray.
  12. Wait for one hour.
  13. Heat oven to 200C
  14. Score dough with a sharp knife.
  15. Bake for 30 minutes.
  16. Cool on the wire rack.

## More Examples

Work through the following two examples:

- Travelling somewhere, e.g., another country, somewhere local, etc. Get down to the low-level steps if possible.
- How to pass the module. Start high-level, then work downwards.
  1. Pass the test >40%.
  2. Pass the coursework >40%.

## Exercises 

1. Design an algorithm for adding the scores as given below:

   26, 49, 98, 87, 62, 75

3. Design an algorithm that generates even numbers between 1000 and 2000 and then prints them.

4. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared, and the parts are swapped if they are not in order. Write Bubble Sort algorithm.  

5. Linear search is a straightforward search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked, and if a match is found, that item is returned; otherwise, the search continues until the end of the data collection. Write a Linear search algorithm. 

6. Design an algorithm when boarding an aeroplane. Each passengers boarding card must be checked; if the card is not for that flight, they should be denied boarding. Otherwise, they may proceed. 

7. Design an algorithm when a user has entered a wrong password, they have the option to have a new password emailed to them. If this option is selected, a new password will be generated; the password will then be sent out in an email to the user and then encrypted and stored in the database. 

8. Design an algorithm for an online banking application that allows users to perform several operations on their bank account. The following description covers the actions of the system once the user has logged in and selected an account. The options will work as follows:

   - Show Balance will retrieve the balance from the database and display it on the page.
   - Show transactions will retrieve a transaction from the database and display it on the page; this will continue until there are no more transactions to display.
