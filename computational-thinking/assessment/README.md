## Assessment Task

The coursework consists of two elements:

1. The design of algorithms using flowcharts and pseudocode.
2. The implementation of your design using Scratch.

## Purpose of the Assessment

- To demonstrate that the learning outcomes have been met
- To demonstrate the application of academic skills to computer science topics
- To demonstrate computational thinking skills by designing an algorithm
- To become familiar with programming by implementing algorithm designs in a Visual Programming Language.

## Learning Outcomes Addressed by this Assignment

- Design a simple algorithm to solve a problem using flowcharts and pseudocode.
- Construct a program to solve a problem using a Visual Programming Language.

### Learning Outcomes Addressed by the Assignment

- Design a simple algorithm to solve a problem using flowcharts and pseudocode.

### Assessment Task

In this assessment, you will create the flowchart and pseudocode for the following three problems.

1. A program that asks the user to enter two numbers. It then tells the user which one is the greatest, which one is the smallest, or if they are both equal states they are both equal.

2. A program that loops, reading numbers from the user and reports whether each value is positive or negative (greater than or less than 0). The loop terminates when the user enters 0 (no message is displayed in this case).

3. A program that loops through the numbers from 1 to 100. For each number it prints the following:

   - If the number is divisible by 3, Fizz.
   - If the number is divisible by 5, Buzz.
   - If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, FizzBuzz.
   - If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, then the number should be printed.

   For example:

   - 1
   - 2
   - Fizz
   - 4
   - Buzz

### Submission

You are to submit the following for each of the three problems:

1. Flowchart
2. Pseudocode

These will be uploaded as a single PDF to Moodle by **2 pm on the 31st of March.**

### Marking Scheme

The following rubric will be used to assess your submission.

| **Criteria**                                                 | **Excellent**                                                | **Very Good**                                                | **Good**                                                     | **Developing**                                               | **Not attempted**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Solution** the completeness of the solution to meet the specification given. | A solution exceeding the specification by considering additional factors. | A completed solution meeting all the specifications.         | A completed solution that does not quite meet all the specifications. | A completed solution is implemented but lacks much of the specification. | The solution does not meet the specification defined.        |
| **Design** ability to decompose a problem into coherent and reusable parts. | The uses appropriate structures and is exceptionally well presented and documented. | The design uses appropriate structures. The overall design is appropriate. | The design generally uses appropriate structures.            | Not all of the selected structures are appropriate. Some of the design elements are appropriately used. | Few if any of the selected structures are appropriate, or the solution is decomposed in ways that make little sense. |
| **Correctness** ability to create pseudocode and flowcharts that reliably produce correct answers. | Pseudocode and flowcharts produce correct answers for all inputs and also consider some edge cases that are less clearly defined in the specification. | Pseudocode and flowcharts produce correct answers for all inputs. | Pseudocode and flowcharts produce correct answers of appropriate results for most inputs. | Pseudocode and flowcharts produce appropriate results for most inputs but can contain miscalculations. | Pseudocode and flowcharts do not produce correct answers for most inputs. |
| **Logic** ability to use correct structures appropriate to the problem domain. | Logic is correct and delivered in a very simple and direct manner, simplifying the overall structures accordingly. | Logic is correct with no obvious error, no redundancy or contradictory conditions. | Logic is mostly correct but may contain occasional errors, redundancy, or contradictory conditions. | Logic is on the right track but shows no recognition of obvious errors. | Logic contains some conditions that specify the opposite of what is required, and may lead to infinite loops. |
| **Clarity** ability to provide a clear solution to the problem for human consumption. | The solution is excellently defined and documented. The overall formatting and other considerations are excellent and provide a well-presented report. | The solution is clearly defined and documented. Formatting and other considerations aid readability. | The solution is generally understandable and has some supporting documentation. The formatting isn't perfect but doesn't cause confusion. | Solution is somewhat understandable and has at least some further clarity points. Formatting sometimes leads to confusion about what was designed. | The solution is not understandable, lacks clarifying documentation, and formatting is inappropriate. |

### Learning Outcome Addressed by this Assignment

- Construct a program to solve a problem using a Visual Programming Language.

### Assessment Task

In this assessment, you will build your programs from Part 1 using Scratch. 

### Submission

You have to submit the following for each of the three problems:

1. Screenshot of your solutions in Scratch with appropriate commentary describing the solution.
2. Saved Scratch project files (.sb3 files) for each solution.
