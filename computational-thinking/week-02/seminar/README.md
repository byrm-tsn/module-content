# Computational Thinking Week 02 Seminar

**Remember to give a break every hour or so.**

**Equipment required:**

- Computer for the slides.
- A ribbon if possible -- use to demonstrate a computer tape.

## Review and Recap

Start the session by asking the students to write down the top three things they learned last week. Then ask them to tell the class. Focus on correcting any misunderstandings and reflecting on the key important take aways.

## Introduction

Ask the question -- how does a computer execute tasks? General discussion point to check understanding, but don't question at the moment. Explore the students' thinking.

Now use an example. Ask the students to do the following (use the slide):

- Stand up.
- Turn 180.
- Step forward.
- Turn 180.
- Step forward.
- Sit down.

State that this is all the computer does -- it follows commands step-by-step. You give it a set of instructions and it executes them one after another.

Now use the ribbon. Treat it as a tape. This is the computer's memory. The computer just goes through its memory one step at a time. It is not clever. Each symbol tells the computer what to do. The symbols are treated as fact -- it won't try to guess if the symbols are correct.

Now ask the students how they travelled here today. You want to find one who took a bus, train, or car. Now ask what would have happened if the bus, train, or car broke down or was cancelled. What would they do?

Reflect that it isn't enough to just follow linear steps. We have to make choices. This allows you to introduce how choice is managed in the computer -- using logic.
