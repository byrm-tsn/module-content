# Computational Thinking Week 02 Seminar

**Remember to give a break every hour or so.**

**Equipment required:**

- Computer for the slides.
- A ribbon if possible -- use to demonstrate a computer tape.

## Review and Recap

Start the session by asking the students to write down the top three things they learned last week. Then ask them to tell the class. Focus on correcting any misunderstandings and reflecting on the key important takeaways.

## Introduction

Ask the question -- how does a computer execute tasks? General discussion point to check understanding, but don't question at the moment. Explore the students' thinking.

Now use an example. Ask the students to do the following (use the slide):

- Stand up.
- Turn 180.
- Step forward.
- Turn 180.
- Step forward.
- Sit down.

State that this is all the computer does -- it follows commands step-by-step. You give it a set of instructions and it executes them one after another.

Now use the ribbon. Treat it as a tape. This is the computer's memory. The computer just goes through its memory one step at a time. It is not clever. Each symbol tells the computer what to do. The symbols are treated as fact -- it won't try to guess if the symbols are correct.

Now ask the students how they travelled here today. You want to find one who took a bus, train, or car. Now ask what would have happened if the bus, train, or car broke down or was cancelled. What would they do?

Reflect that it isn't enough to just follow linear steps. We have to make choices. This allows you to introduce how choice is managed in the computer -- using logic.

## What is Logic?

Return to the switch. Can be:

- On or Off
- 1 or 0
- True or False

**Ask what else we can do with the switch apart from switching it off and on. Lead students to the idea of looking at the switch to see if it is off or on.**

### Sentences

Now introduce the idea of a sentence. What can a sentence be:

- **Question** -- ask someone something.
- **Command** -- tell someone to do something.
- **Statement** -- a sentence that can be true or false.

**Use some example sentences, and ask the students if they are questions, commands, or statements.** Some examples:

- Is it warm outside? -- question
- Go outside. -- command
- How are you today? -- question
- It is warm outside. -- statement
- What is your name? -- question
- My name is Kevin. -- statement
- I believe in the tooth fairy. -- statement
- You should go to university. -- statement (or can argue around command)
- Go to university. -- command
- Walk the dog. -- command

We can now have a statement:

- The switch is on.

And determine if it is true or false. This is something the computer can do. It can check the value of something.

**Use an example the students might be familiar with. For example, searching for a friend on Instagram. How might the computer do this (i.e., look at all accounts until it finds one with the right name)?** 

Reflect on two of the fundamental things a computer can do:

- Change a value (by flicking switches).
- Test a value (by comparing it to something else).

## Boolean Logic

Now introduce the idea of general Boolean logic -- that is true and false. We want to introduce the logical operators:

- And
- Or
- Not

Keep things simple. Build sentences using these operators and determine their truth value.

For each one, also introduce a truth table.

## Lab

Use the Numbas tests on Moodle. Just let the students explore them, help them. Tell them to try multiple times.
