# Visualising data

- Look at https://fastcharts.io.  Play with some of the data and look at how different chart types make the data more meaningful OR change your perception of the data.
- Look at the FT Graphics (bottom of website).  find a chart that interests you and post it onto padlet with your learnings
- Go into excel or google sheets.  use the dataset from last week or find a new one.  Attempt to chart the raw data OR create pivot tables and chart these. Remember to think about cleaning or trimming your data before you start.
- Make notes and start to think about your assessed coursework

post your findings on the padlet:
