# Software Engineering Seminar 04 - Starting Application design

In Sprint 1, you have started to focus your project and the specifications ie. a set of statements that describe the mechanisms needed to solve the problem.

Note that there is no single, correct way to specify an application.  The best tools for the job vary according to context such as:

  * Time/budget available
 * The best way to involve and consult stakeholders (eg. very  technical documentation will not help you involve people who   do not have a high level of technical training)
 * The programming language or framework you are usin
 * Size of team or teams
 * The complexity of the task itself

It is great to have a good general knowledge of specification methods, even if you do not use all of them all of the time.

## Your Task

Today, please identify the user stories that you need to satisfy in order to reach the goals you have set yourself.

"A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. " ([Here](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories))

Remember that user stories are high level, written from a users perspective and are not yet split into developer tasks.  Use the personas you developed to see things from different users' perspective.

The UK Government digital service manual gives a succinct view of user stories you can refer to:

Some examples of how to use your cards are here: [Here](https://www.solutionsiq.com/learning/blog-post/agile-story-card-templates/)


Try to prioritise from the very beginning and if you have additional features/good ideas but they are not essential for your 'MVP' (minimum viable product), keep them in the backlog and tag them as 'nice to have'. Once you have finished all the essential features/requirements then based on your time and resources then you could start implementing the additional features.




### Example

Here are my user stories for the coffee shop reviews example we will look at later in the module, and as a bonus, a 'user story map' I created to easily break the user stories down into development tasks. At the moment, concentrate on the high level story- you can work on the tasks later.

  * As a coffee drinker I want to be able to list reviewed coffee shops in my town so that I can drink good coffee
  * As a coffee drinker I want to be able to rate coffee shops  in my town so that others can drink good coffee
  * As a coffee drinker I want to list the coffee shops that I have rated in the past so I can visit the coffee shops again
