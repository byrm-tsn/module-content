# Seminar 07 

Review your work so far

Consider splitting up tasks: 
* Your frontend developer can go ahead and create templates in pug using     placeholder values. 
*  Your backend developer can start setting up routes in app.js and the framework for querying the database. 
*  Your DBM can start to design the database, create tables and pre-fill values you can work with.

Spend the seminar time reviewing your task board and next steps.

Do you have enought/adequate design documentation to proceed with these tasks separately? If you do not - think about what will still help you.
