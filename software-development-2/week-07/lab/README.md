## Exercises

In the following exercises, you have to tidy the provided code and make it understandable. Use the following process:

1. Auto format the code.
2. Run the program to understand what it does.
3. Rename the functions and variables to something more appropriate. You might have to rename them a few times while you work out what they mean. **Hint -- you should add comments as you go.**
   - All functions have been renamed `Fnnn` where `nnn` is a number.
   - All variables have been renamed `Vnnn` where `nnn` is a number.
   - All `struct` have been renamed `Snnn` where `nnn` is a number.
4. Run the program again to check it is still working.

### Exercise 1

Exercise 1 code is available [here](01.cpp){:target="_blank"}. You have seen this program before, but won't recognise it yet.

### Exercise 2

Exercise 2 code is available [here](02.cpp){:target="_blank"}. You have this program before as well.

### Exercise 3

Exercise 3 code is available [here](03.cpp){:target="_blank"}. You have not seen this code before. You should use documentation to understand what the new code does.
