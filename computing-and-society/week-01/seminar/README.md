## User research exercise: Personas and scenarios


When you first start to plan a software project, using 'personas' can help you to understand what you intend to build from a users' perspective and, further down the line, they provide a way for you to check that your project is succeeding - ie. meeting user needs.

Taken from: https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/personas

(Please look at the examples provided at this link)

"A persona is a description of a target user for a product or service. A persona summarizes the target user’s background, goals, and needs related to the product. The persona helps you better understand your target users, so you can design a solution to meet their expectations.

A persona is based on user research data collected from multiple users through observations, interviews, surveys, etc. However, the persona is presented as a description of an individual person, even though the persona actually represents a group of users with similar characteristics.

The reason for presenting the user data as an individual person is because it is easier to empathize with a description of a specific person, rather than a set of statistics summarizing an entire group.

It is important that a persona is fictional (not an actual individual) yet realistic (based on real data from actual users). Since one purpose of a persona is to develop empathy for the target users, a persona should NOT be humorous or demeaning.

There are different formats for personas, but personas are usually condensed to one-page in length and often contain information such as:

  * __Profile__ (background information about user):
  * __Photo__ (fictional - use stock photo)
  * __Name__ (fictional - first name is sufficient)
  * __Type of User__ (descriptive label or category)
  * __Relevant Demographic Information__ that might affect how product is used or designed (might include: age, gender, occupation/role, etc.)
  * __Other Relevant Background Information__ that might affect how product is used or designed (might include: description of physical, social, and technological environment in which product will be used; user’s proficiency with technology; special knowledge or skills; personality traits; etc.)
  * __Goals and Tasks__ (what goals or purpose does user want to achieve when using the product, and what tasks does user need to complete with the product to meet these goals)
  * __Anxieties and Motivations__ (what influences user’s behaviors and decisions related to adopting a possible new solution to meet the goals and perform the tasks)
  * __Frustrations and Concerns__ (what pain points does user experience with the current situation or current solutions)
  * __Needs and Expectations__ (what are user’s expectations related to the functionality, usability, and user experience of possible new solution)

A product or service might have many different types of users with different backgrounds, goals, and needs. Therefore, different personas could be created to model these different types of users. However, it might not be possible (or desirable) to design a solution that tries to meet the needs of every possible type of user. Often this results in a solution that doesn’t actually satisfy anyone. Instead, it is recommended to identify the primary type of user that will be your main target for designing your solution."



### Your task today

This week and next, you will work towards creating Personas for users of Moodle.  First you should concentrate on creating Personas for student users.  
In groups, please formulate questions that cover the information required to create a Persona, then interview eachother to gather data.

(Later we will give you opportunities to interview lecturers)

Please formulate your questions to ensure you find out:


1. What __background information__ about the person (age, gender, role, experience, etc.) might affect how the product is used or designed? - note that demographic information should only be included if it is RELEVANT.
2. What is the specific __context__ (time, place, etc.) in which the person would use the product? (You might want to consider the use of mobile devices, library, situation at home)
3. What are the __goals and tasks__ that the person wants to achieve when using the product?
4. What are the person’s __frustrations and concerns__ with the current situation or products?
5. What are the person’s __needs and expectations__ that are not currently met?

Now interview eachother and gather data into a structured format eg. spreadsheet.
