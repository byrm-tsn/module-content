# Queues

## Code your algorithm to convert a positive integer to its binary representation using a queue
To make your life easier, you can, for example, use the collections library from Python

``` Python
from collections import deque

q = deque()
q.append('a')
q.append('b')
q.append('c')
print("Initial queue")
print(q)
print(q.popleft())
print(q.popleft())
print(q.popleft())
print("\nQueue after removing elements")
print(q)
```
