# Sorting

## Task: Provide an algorithm that sorts an unsorted list of integers [a1, a2, . . ., a60], with ai in [1,100]. But there is a catch, you need to sort them according to their
tens value. For example, if the input is 
A = [14 20 27 51 23	9 53 19 21 38 15 72 6 25 29 30 40 36 34 18 59 57 7 39  52 42  3 8 31	10 58 5 28  22 37 26 13 4 ]
the sorted list would be
[1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
[10 13 14 15 18 19 
20 21 22 23 25 26 27 28 29
[30 31 34 35 36 37 38 39
[40 42
51 52 53 57 58 59 
72]
