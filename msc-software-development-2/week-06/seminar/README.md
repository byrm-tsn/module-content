# Software Development 2 Seminar 06 -- Team Session

This seminar session is a team session. You should use your time to coordinate and collaborate with your team with a particular focus on what you need to do to complete the next stage of assessment which is your Sprint 2 submission.

To remind you of the specification for sprint 2:

### Sprint 2

#### Submission: 3 November

#### Review Meeting: 8 November

The aim of this Sprint is to check that you have a set of user requirements defined as user stories and that you have designed initial elements of your application.

Submission requirements for this Sprint:

- Full set of user stories defined for your application idea.
- User stories tracked appropriately using a tool.
- Suitable diagrams and documentation used to design software, which may include:
  - Use case diagrams
  - Activity diagrams
  - State diagrams
  - Class diagrams
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Personas
  - User flow diagrams
- Rough designs of the screens (pages) that your application will have and how these flow together. We are looking for wireframes and a high-level overview of how the application flows together. For example, see the following resources:
  - [How to create a user experience flow chart (UX Flow Chart) (startuprocket.com)](https://www.startuprocket.com/articles/how-to-create-a-user-experience-flow-chart-ux-flow-chart)
  - [Mobile Application Design : Paper Prototype Video - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y20E3qBmHpg)



Hints:

1. User stories are mandatory - make sure these are clear and simple.
2. Personas are desirable - they help you understand your application from a users point of view.
3. A user experience flow chart (user flow diagram) will help you break your user stories into tasks.  Create these for each user story.  Note that a user story may require more than one user flow diagram
4. A use case diagram is mandatory.  This is an industry standard so give it a try.
5. Lo-fi prototypes/ wireframes are mandatory. Without these you won't get a shared understanding of what you will build.
6. Try and create an activity diagram for at least one of your user stories.  On this page: [Activity diagrams](http://agilemodeling.com/style/activityDiagram.htm) note the technique of dividing your diagram into 'swim lanes'.  Reflect on whether this is useful to you and the team.

Overall, concentrate on techniques that help you get started with your project, but be willing to try the different ones here and evaluate them for yourselves.  I will be happy to see some reflection on what techniques are most useful in your submission and/or in our review discussion.
