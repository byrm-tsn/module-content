# Software Development 2 Seminar 10 â€“ Team session

Getting ready for sprint 3 - pair programming 

Today you should start on the programming tasks for sprint 3. You may wish to try 'pair programming' for this, see resources on Moodle.

If you have not already created a new project using the scaffolding files and ensured that all members of the team can pull and push, make sure that is in place.
