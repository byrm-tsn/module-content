# Software Development 2 Seminar 03 -- Team Session

Use your seminar time to work with your team and prepare for the Sprint 1 hand-in (which will be reviewed next week).

The brief for Sprint 1 is:

Idea well defined and suitable for a CRUD application
  * Purpose is well defined
  * Business questions are well defined
  * Initial tasks defined
  * Code of conduct included
  * Github repo and task board created 

Remember... 'Less is more' !!  If you can describe your project succinctly, you will better be able to build it!



## Activity

#### 1. Personas and Scenarios

Using personas and scenarios is a way that you can explore your user needs.  This exercise will help you reach a *shared understanding* of the purpose of your application, the context in which people will use it, and a high level view of the functions it should have.  

Later you can build on this understanding of user NEEDS to extract the features and requirements, and express these more formally.

During your agile development methodology, you can return to these Personas to help you think about changed requirements.

Build at least two personas / scenarios as per this article:

https://docs.idew.org/principles-and-practices/practices/design-practices/personas  

(See the example tab)

Once you have done this, you will be better able to formulate a short statement of the purpose and business questions.

#### 2. Purpose

You should aim for a single sentance for the purpose of the format...

'The purpose of this application is to provide a platform where...'

#### 3. Business Questions

Three or four business questions should cover you project:

Example:

(For my case study - coffee shop rating site)

1. How can people find good coffee shops in a particular town?
2. How can keen coffee drinkers rate coffee shops?
3. How can coffee drinkers keep track of coffee shops they have visited before?

#### 4. Outline tasks

These should be generic at this point eg - look ahead in the programme schedule and get a sense of the shape of the project.  Use your task board.

 * Write user stories
 * Create wireframes
 * Testing/evaluation plan 
... etc

#### 5. Appoint your product owner

The product owner 'owns' the backlog - they will ultimately decide if a feature is going to be implemented or not.  They will use your personas and business questions to assess any changed or additional requirements further down the agile development process.
