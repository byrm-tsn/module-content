# Software Development 2 Seminar 5 - User Stories, user flows and breaking your user stories down into tasks


Today you should be working towards your sprint 2 submission which is your specification.

You will need to produce:

  * Full set of user stories defined for your application idea
  * User stories tracked appropriately on your task board
  * Wireframes for your chosen user stories
  * User flow chart or activity diagram for your chosen user stories
  * 
You may also include other diagrams and documentation used to design software, for example:

  * Use case diagrams 
  * State diagrams 
  * Sequence diagrams 
  * Customer Journey maps

Your wireframes should be rough designs of the screens (pages) that your application will have and please indicate how these flow together.   They do not need to be made using a digital tool - photographed sketches are OK. The point is that they should provide a useful specification.

## Your Task

Elect a product owner for this week.  Usually in a project there is just one product owner throughout, but for this project we will rotate this task.

The product owner should lead and structure your team's activities.

1. Review and revise your user stories. When you are happy that you have got these to a good place, add them to your taskboard and break them into several user flows. Represent these as user flow diagrams, and then start sketching lo-fi prototypes that represent the flows.
2. Once you have understood what you are are building ie. how users will interface with it, break the stories down into developer tasks.


## User Stories

Remember that your user stories take the form:

> As a **< user role >**, I can **< activity >** so that **< business value >**.

The parts that need to add are:

- **User role** is who the story involves.  It needs to be specific enough to allow a conversation.  *User* is not a legitimate user role.
- **Activity** is the task the user wants or is required to do.
- **Business value** is why the task is important.

### Wireframes and user flow diagrams

Use this article to find out about BOTH wireframes and user flow diagrams.  You can use the suggestion here to enhance your wireframes with an indication of the flow: [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/wireflows/)



 
### User journey maps

If the 'user journey' in your idea has significant elements that are not online, then taking a service design approach and creating user journey documentation will be useful

### Tasks

Stories can be further decomposed into tasks.  Tasks are pieces of work that can be completed by individual team members.  Tasks also lead to the completion of a user story.

Tasks are different from user stories in that they have a single owner (the person who has taken responsibility for delivering the task) and are estimated in hours rather than points.  A task should typically take a person 4-8 hours to complete.  That is, they are big enough to be a serious piece of work, but not too big to take more than a day of work.

A user story map is a useful way of breaking down simple user stories into actionable tasks
