# Software Development 2 Seminar 01 -- Overview of the course and the technology components

## SD2 - What's it all about?

This course brings together a lot of different technology skills with professional practice and team working.  Its going to be a challenge.


*You will create a web application ie. a dynamic website that fulfills a set of well defined user needs* 

Here are the 'moving parts'

#### Web technologies

* 'Frontend' - HTML markup, CSS styling, Javascript for dynamic features on the page
* 'Backend' - SQL database, node.js / express 'backend' framework
*  Pug templates - for well-formatted front-end code for displaying dynamic and personalised content.

#### Teamworking technologies/tools

* Git - Source code version control
* Docker - consistent development environments and deployment pipeline
* Visual studio Code - your personal 'Integrated Development Environment'

#### Teamworking methods /tools

* Scrum/kanban
* Agile user stories

## What you will do

1. Learn the key web development technologies - frontend then backend
1. Learn about professional development tools
1. Form teams in which you will specify a project, and use the teamworking and frontend/backend technologies to realise it


## Where is all this leading?

* Consider static web pages eg. 'brochureware'
* Now consider a dynamic 'web app' that does something: eg. online shopping, moodle, and that is 'personalised'
* You will use the tools described here to create a dynamic, web app by integrating a 'backend' database, using node.js framework into dynamic web pages

## Exercise

Lets think of some web sites we use frequently and see what we can find out about the frontend/backend technologies they use, and take an educated guess at how they store and retrieve data.

Think of some problems you would like to solve that you think a database-driven website can help with.

## How will we go about this?

* This week, we will start sharing ideas
* We will also put together a project timeline
* Next week, we will form our teams.
* Our teams will use an Agile / scrum methodology to create projects.
* Your assigments will be the results of 3 week 'sprints'
* You will maintain a taskboard, and have regular standups
* You will use professional teamworking methods and tools to specify, organise and develop code
* Though you might have different roles in the group project, EVERYONE should master the fundamentals of building a database-driven application.

*Please use Moodle to share ideas and start to form teams.*
