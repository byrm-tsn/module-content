# Software Development 2 Seminar 02 -- Getting started with your group



## Group Tasks Today

1. __Gather your group together__
2. __Decide who will be your Scrum master today__ (ie. faciltates meeting).  Try to rotate this role on a fortnightly basis.
3. __Decide who will be your product owner__ (ie. oversee the documentation of tasks and their journey through the task board)
4. __Draft your code of conduct__.  Consider what is important to you and what will keep your project on track.  Use the Mozilla code of conduct as a starting point: [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/ "Mozilla code of conduct"). Talk each point through and decide if it is useful to include in your code of conduct.  Decide what additional points you should add that are important in our specific context.  For example you might want to define rules around:
    *  Frequency of meetings 
    *  Gathering work in time for deadlines
    *  What do do if a team member does not particpate
    *  Attending lab sessions
5. __Decide on a technology that will support your Kanban system__. Use the [Kanban reading](./kanban.html "Kanban reading for reference")

Finally - discuss your idea and make a plan for getting to Sprint 1!

### Spotify Engineering Culture

To illustrate how Scrum ideals (and agile principles in general) can work, watch the following video by Spotify:

### FAQs - Scrum Usage in the Module

1. **Do we really need to meet once a day?**

It would be good if you could, but in reality three times a week will probably be enough.  Also, use technology to get around the problem.  MS teams, or similar can allow you to communicate.  The point is to meet at the same time each day for no more than 10-15 minutes. Use the defined Scrum questions.

2. **We cannot find a time to all meet.  What do we do?**

You need to commit to your team and your learning.  You need to see it as a priority.  But life does get in the way.  Talk to a member of the module team to discuss how to resolve.

3. **How will Scrum be used by the teaching team?**

In two ways:

- The assessment is designed with 4 timeboxed sprints.  Each Sprint end will involve a review with a member of the teaching team that will be assessed.
- In every seminar your team will have a 10-minute standup with a member of the teaching team to check how everything is progressing and help you review and reset tasks for the following week.

4. **If we are having a standup does that mean I have to attend every lab?**

Yes.  This is for your benefit.

5. **Does my team have to all be in the same lab session?**

Yes.  You should consider this when organising your team.

6. **Does my team have to work on the lab material together?**

Yes.  You are a team and should see your learning in the module as part of the team effort.

7. **We have a problem with a team member.  What should we do?**

Identify quickly and resolve by addressing with the team member.  If there is a still a problem bring it up at the lab standup.  If you have fallen out then ask yourselves if it can be solved.  Try and be professional and courteous as a team.  Use your code of conduct.

8. **Can we sack a team member?**

We'd prefer not to, but if this is necessary bring it up at the lab standup.
