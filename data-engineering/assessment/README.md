# Coursework Specification

The coursework is worth 100% of the total module mark. Delivery of the coursework is divided into four three-week sprints. You will also be evaluated for your contribution to the project. The marks for the coursework are divided as follows:

| **Title**             | **Deadline**  | **Marks** |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Sprint 1              | 16th February | 20%       |
| Sprint 2              | 9th March     | 20%       |
| Sprint 3              | 30th March    | 20%       |
| Sprint 4              | 27th April    | 20%       |
| Individual Reflection | 27th April    | 20%       |

In this coursework, you are tasked with creating a data engineering system (data pipeline) for a business's smooth and efficient data delivery.

**Your application must be built using the tools and technologies taught in the module, although there is some flexibility.**

You will work on the project as a Scrum team. You were taught about Scrum in Software Engineering, but if unsure, ask the teaching team for more information. **You will work as a team.** You must adopt design and project management methods (Agile, Kanban). You will need to be familiar with the tools of a typical software development team (Visual Studio, Git, Docker) and some of the difficult human and technical issues around collaborating on and continuous improvement of a data delivery system.

**The nature of the data delivery system you deliver is open to you to define. Your limitations are in the technology used (based on those taught in the module) and the scale of the application (significant enough to require using the tools taught in the module).**

You need to do the following for your project:

- Identifying the requirements (functional and non-functional)

- Prioritising the requirements (if applicable)

- Task allocation 

- Identifying the scope of your project

- Identifying the stakeholders

- Risk management

## Group Submission

The coursework **must** be delivered by a group. The module assesses your ability to work as a team to deliver a product. Therefore, **most of your coursework grade will be based on your team's ability to work together using the methods defined in the module.**

The coursework submission is monitored weekly during stand-up lab meetings and formally via the code-review assessment points. Your final submission is delivered via your GitHub repository.

## Individual Assessment

Individual contributions to the team will be assessed based on attendance at the various meetings and code reviews and via the metrics gathered from tools such as GitHub. Individual contributions can lead to a scaling of the overall coursework grade if the team have evidence that illustrates a lack of contribution to the team's deliverable.

The coursework must be delivered as part of a team. **If anyone is dismissed from their team, they cannot deliver the coursework and will fail**. Dismissal from a team involves the following process:

- An individual is evidenced as breaching the student team's code of conduct.

- Evidence is presented at the next available meeting with a member of the module delivery team.

- The individual will have the opportunity to evidence mitigating circumstances either to the student team or privately to a member of the module delivery team.

- The module delivery team retains the right to decide whether the dismissal is warranted.

Any dismissed team member has a week to appeal the decision to the module team with suitable evidence provided.

## Code Review Meetings

Each group will undertake four graded code reviews:

1. Week 4 (20% of CW mark)
2. Week 7 (20% of CW mark)
3. Week 10 (20% of CW mark)
4. Week 12 (20% of CW mark)

The meetings will take place during the lab sessions. Each group will be given 15 minutes maximum for the code review. Your group will be allocated a time for the code review. The details of the individual review points are below. These meetings must be attended at the stated time. Guidelines for grading the group:

- Being late for the meeting or not being ready when the meeting starts will result in the grade for that review being capped at 40%.

- Not attending the meeting will mean the code review will be marked at 0%.

- All team members should attend the code review. However, commitments and other considerations will be taken into account. Individual attendance at reviews will be monitored to ensure the team contributes collectively to the project.

- Being ready means that you are ready to present the points for the code review. This means you have a computer with the various tools logged into (e.g., GitHub) and a building version of the application.

## Sprint Deliverables

### Sprint 1 -- Lab of Week 4

This sprint aims to ensure that the team's project workflow is set up. You may choose to meet some of the feature requirements during this review point, but it is not as necessary.

#### Checklist Submission 1

The following must be in place:

- GitHub project for coursework setup.

- Product backlog created.

- Initial tasks are defined as user stories.

- Kanban/project board being used.

- Sprint boards are being used.

- Necessary starting docker files for the project set up and working.

- Correct branches for GitFlow workflow created -- includes *master*, *develop*, and *release* branches.

- The first release was created on GitHub.

- Code of Conduct defined.

The overall quality of these deliverables, as well as overall metrics from GitHub and code quality, will also be evaluated.
