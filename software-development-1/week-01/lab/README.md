# Software Development 1 
# Lab 1 -- Programming Flags
1. Start the **Anaconda Navigator** application. 
2. Create a **Jupyter notebook** file with Python 3 kernal (ipykernel).
3. Install graphic library through pip
> In this drawing flag task, we will use **graphics.py** library, which is a simple object oriented graphics library designed to make it very easy for novice programmers to experiment with computer graphics in an object oriented fashion. To install graphics.py library, we use package manager **pip**. 


```
!pip install graphics.py
```

4. After the library is installed, import (almost) everything from graphics.py, which allows using the various objects (variables, classes, methods...) from graphics.py without prefixing them with the module's name.
 ```
 from graphics import *
 ```
 
5. In graphics.py, the graphics are drawn in a window. **GraphWin()** can construct a new graphics window for drawing on the screen. The parameters are optional; the default title is “Graphics Window,” and the default size is 200 x 200 pixels.

```
win = GraphWin()
```

6. We can set colour of the background by **setBackground()**.

```
win.setBackground('white')
```

8. We can close the window by **win.close()**

```
win.close()
```

So far, we are able to create a window, set background colour, and close the window. Next, let's explore more.

9. Create a window with given name, width and height.
> As mentioned in step 5, **GraphWin()** can have optional parameters, **GraphWin(title, width, height)**

```
win = GraphWin('name', 600, 400)
```

10. Create a rectangle.
> Windows have coordinates. (0, 0) is the top-left corner. (*w*, *h*) is the bottom-right corner, where *w* is the window width and *h* the height.
> A Rectangle has a start point and end point.

```
rect = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), Point(100, 200))
```

11. Set the colour fill to the rectangle.

```
rect.setFill('blue')
```

12. Draw the rectangle (**rect**) to the window (**win**)

```
rect.draw(win)
```

13. Close the current window

```
win.close()
```

So far we have learnt how to create rectangle with specific colour. Think about the French flag (as below). How can we  draw it by python?
![Alt text][French]

14. Let's create a window in flag size named "France"

```
france = GraphWin('France', 600, 400)
```

The French flag consists of three rectangles with colour blue, white and red.

15. Draw the blue bar on the window.

```
rect = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), Point(200, 400))
rect.setFill('blue')
rect.draw(france)
```

16. Draw the white and red bars on the window.

```
rect = Rectangle(Point(200,0), Point(400, 400)))
rect.setFill('white')
rect.draw(france)
```
> Try the red bar by yourself.

17. Now it's time to try some rectangle-based flags by yourself.

![Alt text][Germany]
![Alt text][Switzerland]
![Alt text][United Arab Emirates]

18. For some circle-based flags (e.g., Japanese flag as below), we use **Circle()** to draw circles. Circles are defined by a centre point and a radius.

```
circle = Circle(Point(100, 100), 50)
```

Similar to rectangle, we can set the colour fill to the circle, and then draw it on the window.

```
circle.setFill(‘red’)
circle.draw(win)
```

19. For some line-based flags (e.g., Scottish flag as below), we use **Line()**. Each line is defined by two points, and we can set the colour (outline) and width of the line. Of course, it can also be drawn on the window.

```
line = Line(Point(0,0), Point(600, 400))
line.setOutline('red')
line.setWidth(80)
line.draw(win)
```

20. Finally, let's look at some more complicated flags baseed on polygons (e.g., Bahamas as below).

![Alt text][Bahamas]. 

We use **Polygon()** to draw polygons, where the polygon corners are defined by parameters. For example, to draw a triangle, we can draw a polygon with three points.

```
tri = Polygon(Point(0,0), Point(200,200), Point(0,400))
```

Also, the colour can be set by **setFill()**.

```
tri.setFill('black')
tri.draw(win)
```

Now I believe you have got enough confidence to draw more challenging flags. Here some advanced flags are prepared for you to play with.

Good luck and have fun!
