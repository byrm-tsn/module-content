
When Albert Einstein was asked, how would allocate time for problem solving, he famously said: “If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions.” Einstein believed the quality of the solution you generate is in direct proportion to your ability to identify the problem you hope to solve. Use all the tools we have learn to identify what the problem is asking you and abstract the components to solve it. You can use all the tools we have learned such as Flowhcharts and debuggin techniques.


How do you make the following program reach the end? Hint: writing down a flowchart might help!

       name = ''
       while name != 'your name': 
         print('Please type your name.') 
         name = input() 
         print('Thank you!')
