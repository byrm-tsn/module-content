## Exercise set 1: While Loop and For loop


1. Transform the following program from an if conditional to a while loop and write a flowchart for each.
```
spam = 0
for spam in range(5):
    spam = spam + 1
    print('spam:', spam)
```
2. Print the following pattern
Write a program to print the following number pattern using a loop.
```
1
1      2
1      2      3
1      2      3      4
1      2      3      4      5      
1      2      3      4      5      6
```

3.  Use while loop to create a program for the following flowchart:

## Exercise set 2: List and Tuple

4. Consider the list **spam = [&#39;cat&#39;, &#39;bat&#39;, &#39;rat&#39;, &#39;elephant&#39;]**. Which is the 0th element? How about the 3rd? What happens when you try to access the element 1000? What happens when you try to access a negative index like **spam[-1]?**

5. In the list **animal\_list = [&#39;cat&#39;, &#39;bat&#39;, &#39;rat&#39;, &#39;elephant&#39;]** , replace the value at index 1 with &quot; **aardvark**&quot;. Can you use assignments to change all the elements on the list to &quot; **aardvark**&quot;?



6. Experiment with List Concatenation and List Replication. What happens when you enter the following?

       [1, 2, 3] + ['A', 'B', 'C']
       
       animal_list = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
       
       animal_list*3
 
7. Transform the list we have created to Tuples by Using ( ) instead of [ ]. Be sure to check their type.

```
empty_tuple = ( )
animal_tuple = ('cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant')
```
