# Software Development 1 
# Lab 2 -- Introduction to Programming

## The contents of this lab will be carried out on a Jupyter Notebook. Information on using Jupyter notebooks can be found at: https://jupyter.org/

In this lab, we’ll further explore 
1.  What is Programming
2.  Programming Languages
3.  Introduction to Python

By the end of this lab and its accompanying seminar, you’ll be able to run Python code via Jupyter Notebooks. You’ll have knowledge of programming concepts, programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Our goal is to make you think as a computer scientist so that when you are faced with a challenge, you’ll immediately think:

> "How am I going to write a piece of code to help me tackle this?"

A few tips: Practice, practice, practice. You can’t passively absorb programming as a skill. Please view the videos before lecture so that you can maximise our time together. Remember that your instructor is not a mind reader, please tell them when you are struggling. Finally, don’t be afraid to try your code, you won’t break your computer!

Let’s get started.
### Warm-up

    # Our first Python program, print out "Hello, world"
    
    print("Hello, world")

> fun fact: Brian Kernighan wrote the first "hello, world" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language developed by Martin Richards. BCPL was used while C was being developed at Bell Labs a few years before the publication of Kernighan and Ritchie's C book in 1972.

## Lesson 1:  What is Programming?

Let's use Python as a Fixed Program Computer such as a Calculator

    1. How many seconds are there in 42 minutes 42 seconds?
    
    2. How many miles are there in 10 kilometres? 
    Hint: there are 1.61 kilometres in a mile.
    
    3. If you run a 10 kilometres race in 42 minutes 42 seconds, 
    what is your average pace (time per mile in minutes and seconds)? 
    What is your average speed in miles per hour?
    

## Lesson 2: Programming Languages

Let's use Python to form a recipe to calculate for the following:

    4. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 π r^3 . 
    What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? 
    How about radius 3.5? 
    
    5. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. 
    Shipping costs $3 in the US for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy.
    What is the total wholesale cost for 40 and 60 copies in the US? 
    In the UK shipping costs £4.50 and £1.90 for each additional copy.
    Today, 1 US dollar = 0.77 British pounds.
    What's the total for 40 and 60 copies in the UK? 
    
    6. I leave my house at 6:52am. I run:
       1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile) 
       3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) 
       1 mile at an easy pace again. 
       At what time do I get home for breakfast?
    

## Lesson 3:  Introduction to Python

We'll explore and expand on some of these concepts in Python via your open Jupyter Notebook. 

    7.What does the variable counter contain after the following code runs? 

    counter = 20
    counter += 1 
    counter
    
    8. Identify what kind of values each one is with type()
       3 * 4
       ‘hi’ 
       -99.1
       False
       4 - 6.0
       3.0 / 6
       0 + 0
       "2.0"
       0.00
       2**3
       “My dog ate my homework"
       7 == 3 + 4
    
    9. Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. 
    It will be on a web page titled “Built-in Functions.” 
    Skim the list of other functions Python has. 
    Look up what the round() function does, and experiment with it.
