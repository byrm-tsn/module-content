1. What should the following expression evaluate to?
```
    "hi" + 'hihi' 
    "hello " * 3
```    
2. Is *socks* a valid variable name? How about *9000*? What’s the difference?

3. What functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point
number, or string version of a value?

4. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
```
    'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.’
```    
5. In Jupyter, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?

6. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?

7. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

8. In math notation, leading zeros are okay, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?

9. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

10. We’ve seen that *n = 42* is legal. 

* What about *42 = n*?

* How about *x = y = 1*?

11 . In some languages every statement ends with a semicolon, **;**. What happens if you put a semicolon at the end of a Python statement?
* What if you put a period at the end of a statement?

12 . In math notation you can multiply *x* and *y* like this: *xy*. What happens if you try that in Python?

13 . What is the result of the following calculation in Python:
```
        3 + 2 * 9 / 10 -1
```
14 . Can you identify the order of precedence of the mathematical operations?
