1. Create a flowchart for the program that reads words from the user until the user enters a blank line. After the user enters a blank line your program should display each word entered by the user. Then remove all the duplicate words. The words should now be displayed in
the same order that they were first entered. For example, if the user enters:
    
    
        first
        second
        first
        third
        second


then your program should display:


    first
    second
    third
