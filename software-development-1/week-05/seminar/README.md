Seminar 5.	

Write a Flowchart or Pseudocode for the following programs:

1. A function that generates a random password. The password should have a random length of between 7 and 10 characters. Each character should be randomly selected from positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table. Your function will not take any parameters. It will return the randomly generated password as its only result. Calling the program should isplay the randomly generated password. Tip: You will probably find the *chr* function helpful when completing this exercise. Detailed information about this function is available online.


2. A function that takes a string, s, as its first parameter, and the width of the window in characters, w, as its second parameter. Your function will return a new string that includes whatever leading spaces are needed so that s will be centred in the window when the new string is printed. The new string should be constructed in the following manner:
a. If the length of s is greater than or equal to the width of the window then s should be returned.
b. If the length of s is less than the width of the window then a string containing (len(s) - w) 2 spaces followed by s should be returned. Calling this function should display any strings centred in the window.
