Write a flowchart for the function that generates a random password. The password should have a random length of between 7 and 10 characters. Each character should be randomly selected from positions 33 to 126 in the ASCII table. Your function will not take any parameters. It will return the randomly generated password as its only result. Display the randomly generated password by calling the program. Tip: You will probably find the *chr* function helpful when completing this exercise. Detailed information about this function is available online.
