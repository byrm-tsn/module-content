Seminar 5.	

Write a Flowchart or Pseudocode for the following programs:

1. Write a function that takes three numbers as parameters and returns the median value of those parameters as its result. Include a main program that reads three values from the user and displays their median. Tip: The median value is the middle of the three values when they are sorted into ascending order. It can be found using if statements, or with a little bit of mathematical creativity.


2. A function that takes a string, s, as its first parameter, and the width of the window in characters, w, as its second parameter. Your function will return a new string that includes whatever leading spaces are needed so that s will be centred in the window when the new string is printed. The new string should be constructed in the following manner:
a. If the length of s is greater than or equal to the width of the window then s should be returned.
b. If the length of s is less than the width of the window then a string containing (len(s) - w) 2 spaces followed by s should be returned. Calling this function should display any strings centred in the window.


3. A function that generates a random password. The password should have a random length of between 7 and 10 characters.
