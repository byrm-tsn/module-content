1. **Summing Integers:** Design a recursive function that computes the sum of all the integers from 0 up to and including some positive integer, n.



2. **String Reversal** : Using recursion, write a function that computes the reverse of a string.

The basic idea is to think of a string as a recursive object; a large string is composed out of smaller objects, which are also strings. In fact, one very handy way to divide up virtually any sequence is to think of it as a single first item that just happens to be followed by another sequence. In the case of a string, we can divide it up into its first character and &quot;all the rest.&quot; If we reverse the rest of the string and then put the first character on the end of that, we&#39;ll have the reverse of the whole string.



3. **Anagrams** : Write a function that generates a list of all the possible anagrams of a string.

An anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of a word. Anagrams are often used in word games, and forming anagrams is a special case of generating the possible permutations (rearrangements) of a sequence, a problem that pops up frequently in many areas of computing and mathematics.
