1. Make a flowchart for the program that &quot;guesses a number&quot; you&#39;ve set. When you run this program, the output will look like this:


        I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20

        Take a guess.

        10
        
        

        Your guess is too low.

        Take a guess.

        15
        
        

        Your guess is too low.

        Take a guess.

        17
        
        

        Your guess is too high.

        Take a guess.

        16
        
        

        Good job! You guessed my number in 4 guesses!
