# Operating Systems Seminar 10

- Even though the OSI model of networking specifies seven layers of functionality, most computer systems use fewer layers to implement a network. Why do they use fewer layers? What problems could the use of fewer layers cause?
- In what ways is using a name server better than using static host tables?
- The lower layers of the OSI network model provide datagram service, with no delivery guarantees for messages. A transport-layer protocol such as TCP is used to provide reliability. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of supporting reliable message delivery at the lowest possible layer.
- Determine the IP addresses of the following host names:
  - www.roehampton.ac.uk
  - www.apple.com
  - www.microsoft.com
  - www.google.com
  - www.ietf.org
- What are the advantages and the disadvantages of making the computer network transparent to the user?
