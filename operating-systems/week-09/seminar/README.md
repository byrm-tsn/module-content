# Operating Systems Seminar 09

- The access-control matrix can be used to determine whether a process can switch from, say, domain A to domain B and enjoy the access privileges of domain B. Is this approach equivalent to including the access privileges of domain B in those of domain A?
- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of implementing an access matrix using access lists that are associated with objects.
- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of implementing an access matrix using capabilities that are associated with domains.
- How are the access-matrix facility and the role-based access-control facility similar? How do they differ?
- How does the principle of least privilege aid in the creation of protection systems?
- How can systems that implement the principle of least privilege still have protection failures that lead to security violations?
